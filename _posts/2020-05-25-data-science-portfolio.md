## Classification Problem 

### Census Income Classification with Bayesian Optimization

<span class="justify"> The realization of this project was part of my PhD course 80-629 Machine Learning for Large-Scale Data Analysis and Decision Making under the direction of Laurent Charlin at HEC Montreal. The data for this project was taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The goal was to solve a binary classification task to determine whether a person makes over 50k a year. The core of the project lies in the application of the bayesian optimization  to fine-tune the hyperparameters. To achieve this, we've used the package `scikit-optimize`. </span>
