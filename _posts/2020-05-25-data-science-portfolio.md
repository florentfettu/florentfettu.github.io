title: My Data Science Portfolio

This portfolio highlights that I've worked through a variety of case studies and I've gained "industry-like experience".

## Classification Problems

### Census Income Classification with Bayesian Optimization

The realization of this project was part of my PhD course 80-629 Machine Learning for Large-Scale Data Analysis and Decision Making under the direction of Laurent Charlin at HEC Montreal. The data for this project was taken from the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/census+income" target="_blank">UCI Machine Learning Repository</a>. The goal was to solve a binary classification task to determine whether a person makes over 50k a year. The core of the project lies in the application of the bayesian optimization  to fine-tune the hyperparameters. To achieve this, we've used the package `scikit-optimize`.

### Coding a Binary Tree Classifier from Scratch

The realization of this project was part of my master course 60-607 Algorithms for Optimization and Big Data Analysis under the direction of Gilles Caporossi at HEC Montreal. The aim of this project was to develop from scratch an algorithm in python without using any third party package, or as little as possible. We decided to build our own binary tree classifier. Our algorithm was less efficient than sklearn's decision tree classifier to predict 1 million observations but we managed to get better accuracy on the Iris dataset.

## Regression Problems

### Health Care Cost Forecast by using Linear Regression

The realization of this project was part of my master course 60-619 Analysis and Statistical Inference under the direction of Ferdaous Somrani at HEC Montreal. It should be mentioned that it was originally made in SAS but I transcribed it in Python. The data for this project was taken from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance" target="_blank">Kaggle</a>. The goal of our analysis was to assess the impact of the body mass index and being a smoker (or not) on the costs of health insurance in the United States, taking into account socio-demographic variables.
