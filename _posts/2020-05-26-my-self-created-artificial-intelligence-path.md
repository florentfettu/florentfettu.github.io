## Summary

The path of learning about Artificial Intelligence is often overwhelming with complex math and technical topics. Over the last year, I’ve been studying full time to break into AI along my master’s degree in Business Intelligence at HEC Montreal. Throughout my journey, I’ve collected an incredible amount of ressources and decided to showcase only ones that I found relevant. Let’s get started!

## Python Programming Fundamentals

Basic programming knowledge is essential to succeed in data science. Since I was going to spend a lot of time learning new things, I also took a course to become an efficient learner.

## Mathematics, Statistics and Probabilities

Nowadays, thanks to various frameworks and libraries, much of the math work is done behind the scenes. However, having an intuitive understanding of the math helped me immensely with lots of underlying concepts. Due to my background in economics, I had already some mathematical prerequisite.
