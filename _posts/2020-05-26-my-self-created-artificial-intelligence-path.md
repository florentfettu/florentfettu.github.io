## Summary

The path of learning about Artificial Intelligence is often overwhelming with complex math and technical topics. Over the last year, I’ve been studying full time to break into AI along my master’s degree in Business Intelligence at HEC Montreal. Throughout my journey, I’ve collected an incredible amount of ressources and decided to showcase only ones that I found relevant. Let’s get started!
